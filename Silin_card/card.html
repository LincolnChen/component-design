        <h4>Why reference?</h4>
        <p>Referencing is necessary to avoid plagiarism, to verify quotations, and to enable readers to follow-up and read more fully the cited author's arguments. There are many reasons for you to use references.</p>
        <div id="bhover" class="readmore">Read more

          <p>You are indicating that you have read published writing in the area you are studying. Referencing allows you support your arguments. You demonstrate that you are aware of and understand other opinions in the area you are studying by referring to authors who have written about them. Using references allows you to demonstrate your ability to assess, compare and contrast, critically analyse and evaluate competing arguments. Referring to documented evidence lends weight to and validates your argument. Accurate references allow others to consult the same sources you have used. To avoid plagiarism, you need to reference, in text and in the reference list, accurately.
