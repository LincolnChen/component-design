        <h4>Why referencing is important?</h4>
        <p>Referencing is necessary to avoid plagiarism, to verify quotations, and to enable readers to follow-up and read more fully the cited author's arguments. There are many reasons for you to use references.</p>

          <p>Referencing allows you support your arguments. Using references allows you to demonstrate your ability to assess, compare and contrast, critically analyse and evaluate competing arguments. Accurate references allow others to consult the same sources you have used. To avoid plagiarism, you need to reference, in text and in the reference list, accurately.
