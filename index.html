    <h2>Introduction to Referencing</h2>


  <p class="desc">Learning at university may be different to learning at school or college. Lecturers will not usually supply you with all the reading you need to complete your assignments. When you write academic assignments, you must demonstrate your wide reading by citing ideas or concepts from this wide reading.
     Plagiarism can easily be avoided if you document the relevant sources which you have used.
    If you would still like further information, please contact staff from the Academic Language and Learning Success Program (ALLSP), also known as A L L S P or allsp, who run free workshops for internal and external students on Harvard and APA styles.

      <h4>Academic integrity and Plagiarism</h4>
      <p>Referencing is necessary to avoid plagiarism, to verify quotations, and to enable readers to follow-up and read more fully the cited author's arguments.</p>

        <p> <li>1. You are indicating that you have read published writing in the area you are studying.<br>
              2. Referencing allows you support your arguments.<br>
              3. You demonstrate that you are aware of and understand other opinions in the area you are studying by referring to authors who have written about them.<br>
              4. Using references allows you to demonstrate your ability to assess, compare and contrast, critically analyse and evaluate competing arguments.<br>
              5. Referring to documented evidence lends weight to and validates your argument.<br>
              6. Accurate references allow others to consult the same sources you have used.<br>
              7. To avoid plagiarism, you need to reference, in text and in the reference list, accurately.</li>
